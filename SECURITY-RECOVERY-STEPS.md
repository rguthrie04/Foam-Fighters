# üö® FIREBASE API KEY SECURITY INCIDENT - RECOVERY STEPS

## COMPLETED ACTIONS ‚úÖ
- [x] Made GitHub repository private 
- [x] Removed API key from code and replaced with environment variable
- [x] Added comprehensive .gitignore to prevent future exposure
- [x] Committed security fixes

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (DO NOW!)

### 1. Regenerate Firebase API Key (CRITICAL)
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/foam-fighters-2700b/settings/general
2. Scroll to "Web apps" section
3. Click the gear icon next to your web app
4. Click "Add another key" (or generate new key)
5. **COPY THE NEW KEY IMMEDIATELY**
6. Replace "REPLACE_WITH_NEW_API_KEY_AFTER_REGENERATION" in firebase-config.js

### 2. Disable Old API Key
1. In Firebase Console > Project Settings > General
2. Find the old key: `AIzaSyAq3391y-zteKePHTattVUDd3ghpdIDYU0`
3. Delete or disable it immediately

### 3. Monitor Usage (Next 24 Hours)
- Check Firebase Console > Usage & Billing for unusual activity
- Monitor your Google Cloud Console for unexpected API calls
- Watch for any unauthorized authentication attempts

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
1. Create `.env` file in your project root:
```bash
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here
```
2. Never commit this .env file to git
3. Use this for local development

### 5. Production Deployment
- When deploying to production, set environment variables in your hosting platform
- Firebase Hosting: Use Firebase functions environment config
- Other hosting: Set environment variables in your deployment platform

## SECURITY BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED

### ‚úÖ Code Changes Made:
- Removed hardcoded API key from source code
- Added environment variable support
- Enhanced .gitignore to prevent future exposure
- Added security comments and warnings

### ‚úÖ Repository Security:
- Made repository private
- Added comprehensive .gitignore
- Documented security procedures

## PREVENTION MEASURES

### Never Commit These Files:
- `.env` files
- Any config files with API keys
- Firebase config files with real keys
- Google service account JSON files
- Private key files

### Always Use:
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Private repositories for commercial projects
- Regular security audits of your code
- Separate keys for development/production

## MONITORING

Check these regularly:
- Firebase Console > Usage tab
- Google Cloud Console > Billing
- Your site analytics for unusual traffic
- Email for any Google security alerts

## IF YOU SEE SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY:
1. Immediately disable ALL API keys
2. Generate new keys
