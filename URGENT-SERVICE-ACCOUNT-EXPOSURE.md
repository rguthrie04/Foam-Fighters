## WHAT HAPPENED
- A Firebase Admin SDK service account private key was accidentally shared
- This key provides FULL administrative access to the Firebase project
- Key ID: `6732907b94ae020058b6b258b221e1eedcfc32b3`
- Service Account: `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@foam-fighters-2700b.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

4. Find key ID: `6732907b94ae020058b6b258b221e1eedcfc32b3`

### 2. MONITOR PROJECT ACCESS (Next 24 Hours)
- Check Firebase Console > Authentication for new users
- Check Firestore for unauthorized data access
- Monitor Cloud Console > IAM for permission changes

2. Scroll to "Your apps" ‚Üí Click your web app
3. Copy the `apiKey` value from the config object
4. This is safe to use in your frontend code

- ‚úÖ Manage user accounts (create/delete)
- ‚úÖ Access/modify Firebase Storage
- ‚úÖ Change project settings
