## üìã **Copy This Entire Prompt for New Session:**

---

**Context:** I'm continuing work on the Foam Fighters website (foamfighters.uk) lead generation system. We have successfully built and deployed the website with working forms, but need to complete the email notification integration.

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Website deployed: https://foam-fighters-2700b.web.app
- ‚úÖ Forms working and submitting successfully
- ‚úÖ Firebase backend processing form data
- ‚úÖ Zoho email account created: notifications@foamfighters.uk
- ‚è≥ Email notifications need to be integrated

**CRITICAL EMAIL SETTINGS (Just Configured):**
```
Account: notifications@foamfighters.uk
SMTP Server: smtppro.zoho.com
SMTP Port: 465
SMTP Mode: SSL
App Password: avfLW8KqWikH
```

**Firebase Project:** foam-fighters-2700b
**Region:** europe-west2 (London)

**Current Issue:** 
Forms submit successfully but email notifications are disabled in the backend. Need to:
1. Configure Firebase environment variables with Zoho SMTP settings
2. Re-enable email service in backend/index.js
3. Deploy and test complete email system

**Project Structure:**
- Frontend: React/Vite deployed to Firebase Hosting
- Backend: Firebase Functions (Node.js)
- Email: Zoho SMTP (notifications@foamfighters.uk)
- Forwarding: Cloudflare routes to cheryl.dawnsmith36@gmail.com and ryanguthrie@zoho.com

**Key Files to Check:**
- `backend/index.js` (email service currently commented out)
- `backend/services/emailService.js` (email template service)
- `backend/templates/new_inquiry.hbs` (email template)

**Next Steps Needed:**
1. Set Firebase environment variables for Zoho SMTP
2. Re-enable email service in backend
3. Test complete form-to-email flow
4. Verify email delivery to personal accounts

**Test Form URL:** https://foam-fighters-2700b.web.app (quote form on homepage)

**Expected Email Flow:**
Customer fills form ‚Üí Firebase processes ‚Üí Zoho sends email ‚Üí Cloudflare forwards ‚Üí Personal inboxes

Please help me complete the email integration using the Zoho SMTP settings provided above.
