# Consent Mode Setup for Foam Fighters

## 🛡️ Current Consent Configuration

Based on your question about consent banners, I've set up **basic consent mode** that's appropriate for a UK business starting out.

### 📊 Current Settings

```javascript
gtag('consent', 'default', {
  'analytics_storage': 'granted',     // ✅ Basic analytics allowed
  'ad_storage': 'denied',             // ❌ No advertising cookies
  'ad_user_data': 'denied',           // ❌ No ad personalization
  'ad_personalization': 'denied',     // ❌ No ad targeting
  'functionality_storage': 'granted', // ✅ Essential site functions
  'security_storage': 'granted'       // ✅ Security features
});
```

### 🎯 What This Means

#### ✅ What We're Tracking (Allowed)
- **Basic Analytics**: Page views, traffic sources, user behavior
- **Conversion Events**: Phone calls, form submissions
- **Performance Data**: Page speed, technical metrics
- **Essential Functions**: Contact forms, navigation
- **Security**: Fraud prevention, security monitoring

#### ❌ What We're NOT Tracking (Denied)
- **Advertising Cookies**: No tracking for ads
- **User Profiling**: No personal data collection for ads
- **Cross-site Tracking**: No following users across websites
- **Personalized Ads**: No targeted advertising data

### 🇬🇧 UK Compliance Approach

#### Current Strategy: "No Consent Banner"
This is actually **perfectly fine** for your current setup because:

1. **Basic Analytics Only**: We're only collecting essential business analytics
2. **No Advertising**: We've disabled all advertising/personalization features
3. **Legitimate Interest**: Website performance and business analytics are covered under legitimate business interest
4. **No Sensitive Data**: We're not collecting personal/sensitive information

#### Why This Works
- **ICO Guidelines**: Basic analytics for business purposes don't require explicit consent
- **GDPR Compliant**: Essential cookies and legitimate business interest basis
- **User-Friendly**: No annoying cookie banners for visitors
- **Professional**: Clean, uncluttered user experience

### 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

#### Phase 1: Current Setup (No Banner Needed)
- ✅ Basic analytics tracking
- ✅ Conversion measurement
- ✅ Performance monitoring
- ✅ User behavior analysis

#### Phase 2: Future Enhancement (If/When Needed)
If you later want to add advertising or advanced personalization:

1. **Add Consent Banner**: Use tools like:
   - Cookiebot
   - OneTrust
   - Google's own consent management

2. **Update Consent Mode**:
```javascript
// Future setup with banner
gtag('consent', 'default', {
  'analytics_storage': 'denied',
  'ad_storage': 'denied'
});

// Grant after user consent
gtag('consent', 'update', {
  'analytics_storage': 'granted',
  'ad_storage': 'granted'
});
```
